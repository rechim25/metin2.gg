                A Curated Vanilla experience with no Pay2Win, no Pay4Convenience , no option to buy power, in which all
                your invested time is respected and
                provides progress to your character.
                How do we run our server?
                The only thing that can be bought with real life currency are skins.
                The skins in our server are bound to a specific item so we do not ruin the visual progression of metin.(
                imagine )
                The skin in the image can only be equipped while wearing a Red Iron Blade.
                That means that when you see a player in Black steel you can be sure that he is actually wearing that
                armour
                and you won't see a lvl 1 wearing a Full Moon Sword.
                We will NEVER add any flashy skins, wings or crazy mounts. We respect the artistic direction of the
                game.

            <div class="text-panel-row panel-with-bg">
                We are not the ones that created metin2 and had its success, so the ideea behind is that the guys at
                YMIR Entertainment thought
                it a lot better than we could. So why change it? Our gameplay stays true to the original nature of
                Metin2, while removing
                all artificial money sinks so that the players can immerse themselves in Metin2.

                We hope we have created the DEFINITIVE VERSION of Metin2. We are now all students and understand that
                maybe this will be our last metin2
                server we will play, so we wanted to create ourselves the best metin2 server we have ever played.
